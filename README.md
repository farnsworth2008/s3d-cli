# S3D Club CLI Tool
The `s3d` CLI tool is inspired by the many other great CLI commands we use on a
daily basis.

Our CLI tool performs important functions to support our view of software
development. Often commands in our tool perform orchestratraion of other tools. 

Our CLI uses [spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra#overview). All
commands have help screens explaining what they do. We will evententually also
have document pages on the [s3d.club](https://s3d.club/) page with a discussion
of how the commands support our opinionated workflow.
